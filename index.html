            Last few months after I have moved in Germany, I spent learning German
            and techs of modern web. I read a lot of tutorial and books. I made a
            great progress in field of JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, AngularJS and Sass.
            I had time to experiment with various technologies. Learn something
            about Design, Typograhy, Color Theory. I also tried Python. It was
            a fancy time, in which I developed myself.

            In the february 2013 I returned from the Australia and continued work on
            the australian projects. But after few days back home everything changed.
            We wanted to develop new generation of insurance product and the developers
            with know-how were needed. I had enough know-how and java experience, so I
            chose to become a developer again. It was a nice new start. I learned and
            mastered lot of new skills (Java, MongoDB, GIT, Groovy, JavaScript ...) and
            in combination with my analysis skills it was pleasure to code. I participated
            on the whole development process, mainly on the business backend, but also
            wrote few lines of the framework code. And as the guy with know-how I designed lot of UI/UX features. But after lot of design meetings and first lines of JS code I understood, that I want to participate on creation of code more than on the analysis. I started learn JS and did few MongoDB courses. Finally I decided not to move to Australia, also because my girlfriend got a job in Germany. I started again learn german language and in December moved to Germany, to beautiful city of Freiburg. I remotely continued work for Gratex International till March.

            At the end of the october 2012 I got a offer to work for Gratex
            International AUST in Sydney, Australia. They needed help and I was
            the first choice in my current company. I couldn't say 'no'. I had to
            leave in two weeks, so the 5th of November I landed in Sydney. I had
            only few days to became a valid part of the team. Then I was responsible
            for new part of insurance system and I also had to teach new analyst.
            I spent most of the time in the work (even didn't have a chance to see
            kangaroo) with editing of the analysis, communication with customers
            and developers and testing the app. I mainly worked with UML2.0, BPMN,
            MS Word and also did few presentations. At the end of this journey
            I got the offer for 2 years fulltime job.

            After the first step in IBM as web developer, I got a chance to work
            for Gratex International, big slovak IT company. I took this chance
            and became a software analyst. It was a change, but I had a good
            knowledge from the University and I wanted to taste the work of
            Analyst on my own. I spent two years on various international projects
            (EU, Australia). During this time I was designing workflows, db
            structure and architecture of the software systems. I mastered the
            UML2.0, BPMN and various own pseudo languages to described workflows
            or screens. I also designed UX of user interfaces and helped teammates
            with SQL. In this period I acquired the experiences with work in
            various teams from 5 to 40 teammates. For few months I had the chance
            to lead a small team of 5 people and create reverse analysis of
            insurance system. Then a job in australian office was offered to me.

            In the summer 2010, during the summer holiday, IBM gave me the first
            real opportunity to work in IT. Before this job I worked only on the
            side projects and study assignments. Here I had to communicate in
            english and solved the real tasks. I was a part of team which created
            and administered the websites of 'Smarter Planet for whole world.
            That's the story how I started to work.
